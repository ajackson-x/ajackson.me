### My blueprint

> An ode to [Luc Levesque's Blueprint](https://luclevesque.com/blogs/luc-levesques-blog/leader-blueprint-how-to-help-new-employees-be-rockstars-a-new-approach)

1. **Life is learning**


Constantly learning is what drives me. To me it is the biggest gift we can give to each other. It makes us better. If you give off the impression you know it all, I switch off.

2. **Be your best**


This first comes from valuing yourself and is then amplified by the team around you. Be confident and have confidence in those around you. Together Codat is going to change the world and that's all down to the people around you.

3. **Over-share**


I’m an over sharer. I find it easy to be open and I think there’s humour in our fragilities. I also think if I show you vulnerability, it might be reciprocated and this forms a deeper level of trust.

4. **Your differences make the difference**


I will see and champion the things you do well, that I don’t. This is what makes teams succeed (and the robots lose).
